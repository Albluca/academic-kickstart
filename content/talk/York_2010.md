abstract = "Granuloma is a mechanism employed by the immune system to contain and overcome the infection caused by some parasites, such as leishmania. The seminar will present a mathematical model (stochastic petri net) of hepatic granulomas, discussing some of the challenges posed by the modelling process and addressing the main immunological problems that the model will study."
