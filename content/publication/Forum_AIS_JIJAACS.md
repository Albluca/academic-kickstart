abstract = "Leishmania donovani is an obligate intracellular parasite responsible for the systemic disease visceral leishmaniasis. During the course of the disease, the parasite is found in the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Characteristic of the liver immune response to leishmaniasis is a type of inflammation (“granulomatous inflammation”) that results in the formation of granulomas, structures comprised of an infiltrate of mononuclear cells surrounding a core of infected macrophages. Granulomas help limit the spread of infection and facilitate the killing of parasites. This paper introduces a model of granuloma formation and maintenance."
