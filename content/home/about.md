# Biography

I'm a researcher working on the development of machine learning algorithms to gain insights from complex data, with a particular focus on biology.

In 2006, I obtained a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Milan with a thesis on Cryptography. Then, in 2010, I obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the same University with a thesis centered on Computational biology.

In 2011, I joined the group of Computational Systems Biology at the University of Dundee (Dundee, UK), where I developed new computational tools to investigate cancer biology by analyzing gene networks, cellular karyotypes, DNA repair mechanisms, DNA mutations and  epidemiological data.

In 2016, I joined the group of Computational Systems Biology of Cancer at the Institut Curie (Paris, France), where I am developing new computational tools to explore the activity of biological pathway and to infer gene expression dynamics from single-cell transcriptomics data.
